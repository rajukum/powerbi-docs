# Private endpoints for accessing Power BI

Azure networking provides the Azure Private Link feature that enables Power BI to provide secure access via Azure Networking private endpoints. With Azure Private Link and private endpoints, data traffic is sent privately using Microsoft's backbone network infrastructure, and thus the data doesn’t traverse the Internet. 

Private endpoints ensure that Power BI users use the Microsoft private network backbone when going to resources in the Power BI service.

You can learn more about [Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link/).

## Understanding private endpoints

Private endpoints guarantee that traffic going *into* your organization’s Power BI artifacts (such as reports, or workspaces) always follow your organization's configured private link network path. User traffic to your Power BI artifacts must come from the established private link, and you can configure Power BI to deny all requests that don’t come from the configured network path. 

Private endpoints *do not* guarantee that traffic from Power BI to your external data sources, whether in the cloud or on premises, is secured. Rather, you must configure firewall rules and virtual networks that further secure your data sources. 

### Power BI and private endpoint integration

Azure Private Endpoint for Power BI is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to the Power BI service, powered by Azure Private Link.   

Private Endpoints integration enables Platform as a Service (PaaS) services to be deployed and accessed privately from customer's virtual and on-premises networks, while the service is still running outside of customer’s network. Private Endpoints is a single, directional technology that lets clients initiate connections to a given service, but it does not allow the service to initiate a connection into customer network. This Private Endpoint integration pattern provides management isolation, since the service can operate independently of customer network policy configuration. For multi-tenant services, this Private Endpoint model provides link identifiers to prevent access to other customers' resources hosted within the same service. When using Private Endpoints, only a limited set of other PaaS service resources can be accessed from services using the integration.  

The Power BI service implements Private Endpoints, and not Service Endpoints.  

Using private endpoints with Power BI provide the following benefits:

1. Private endpoints ensure that traffic will flow over the Azure backbone to a private endpoint for Azure cloud-based resources. 

2. Network traffic isolation from non-Azure based infrastructure, such as on-premises access, would require customers to have ExpressRoute or a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configured.  

## Using secure private endpoints to access Power BI

In Power BI, you can configure and use an endpoint that enables your organization to access Power BI privately. To configure private endpoints you must be a Power BI administrator, and have permissions in Azure to create and configure resources such as Virtual Machines (VMs) and Virtual Networks (V-Net). 

The steps that enable you to securely access Power BI from private endpoints are:

1. [Enable private endpoints for Power BI](#enable-private-endpoints-for-power-bi)
2. [Create a Power BI resource in the Azure portal](#create-a-power-bi-resource-in-the-azure-portal)
3. [Create a virtual network](#create-a-virtual-network)
4. [Create a virtual machine (VM)](#create-a-virtual-machine-vm)
5. [Create a private endpoint](#create-a-private-endpoint)
6. [Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP)](#connect-to-a-vm-using-remote-desktop-rdp)
7. [Access Power BI privately from the virtual machine](#access-power-bi-privately-from-the-vm)
8. [Disable public access for Power BI](#disable-public-access-for-power-bi)
The following sections provide additional information for each step.

## Enable private endpoints for Power BI

To get started, log in into Power BI at app.powerbi.com as an administrator, and navigate to the Admin portal. Select **Tenant settings** and scroll to the **Advanced Networking**, then toggle the radio button to turn on **Azure Private Link**, as shown in the following image. 

It takes approximately 15 minutes to configure a private link for your tenant, which includes configuring a separate FQDN for the tenant in order to communicate privately with Power BI services.

Once completed, you can move on to the next step.

## Create a Power BI resource in the Azure portal

Next, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and create a Power BI resource, using an **Azure Template**. Replace the parameters in the ARM template example, shown in the following table, to create a Power BI resource.


|**Parameter**  |**Value**  |
|---------|---------|
|```<resource-name>```    | myPowerBIResource         |
|```<tenant-object-id>```     | 52d40f65-ad6d-48c3-906f-1ccf598612d4         |

Create the ARM template 

```
{
  "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {},
  "resources": [
      {
          "type":"Microsoft.PowerBI/privateLinkServicesForPowerBI",
          "apiVersion": "2020-06-01",
          "name" : "<resource-name>",
          "location": "global",
          "properties" : 
          {
               "tenantId": "<tenant-object-id>"
          }
      }
  ]
}
```

In the dialog that appears, select the checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions, and then select **Purchase**.

    The following image shows the **Create a private endpoint - Resource** window.
    
    ![Create a private endpoint, resource](media/service-security-private-links/service-private-links-07.png)

5. Once that information is properly input, select **Next: Configuration** and in the **Create a private endpoint (Preview) - Configuration** and enter or select the following information:

    |Settings |	Value |
    |-------------------|---------|
    |**NETWORKING** ||
    |Virtual network|	Select *myVirtualNetwork* |
    |Subnet	|Select *mySubnet* |
    |**PRIVATE DNS INTEGRATION** ||
    |Integrate with private DNS zone|	Select **Yes** |
    |Private DNS Zone	|Select <br> *(New)privatelink.analysis.windows.net* <br> *(New)privatelink.pbidedicated.windows.net* <br> *(New)privatelink.tip1.powerquery.microsoft.com* |
    
    The following image shows the **Create a private endpoint - Configuration** window.
    
    ![Create a private endpoint, configuration](media/service-security-private-links/service-private-links-08.png)
    
    Next select **Review + create**, which displays the **Review + create** page where Azure validates your configuration. When you see the **Validation passed** message, select **Create**.

## Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop (RDP)

Once you've created your virtual machine, called **myVM**, connected to it from the Internet using the following steps:

1. In the portal's search bar, enter *myVm*.
2. Select the **Connect** button. Once you select the **Connect** button, **Connect to virtual machine** opens.
3. Select **Download RDP File**. Azure creates a Remote Desktop Protocol (.rdp) file and downloads it to your computer.
4. Open the downloaded .rdp file.
5. If prompted, select **Connect**.
6. Enter the username and password you specified when creating the VM in the previous step.
7. Select **OK**.
8. You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. If you receive a certificate warning, select **Yes** or **Continue**.

## Access Power BI privately from the VM

The next step is to access Power BI privately, from the virtual machine you created in the previous step, using the following steps: 

1. From Azure portal, click on Private Endpoint created above(myPrivateEndpoint). 
2. From the left navigation select **DNS Configuration**, note down FQDN for api.analysis.windows.net. In my case it is 52d40f65ad6d48c3906f1ccf598612d4-api.privatelink.analysis.windows.net.
3. In the Remote Desktop of myVM, open PowerShell.
4. Enter nslookup 52d40f65ad6d48c3906f1ccf598612d4-api.privatelink.analysis.windows.net.
5. You'll receive a message similar to this:

    ```
    Server:  UnKnown
    Address:  168.63.129.16
    
    Non-authoritative answer:
    Name:    52d40f65ad6d48c3906f1ccf598612d4-api.privatelink.analysis.windows.net
    Address:  10.5.0.4
    ```

4. Open the browser and go to app.powerbi.com to access Power BI privately.

## Disable public access for Power BI

Lastly, you need to disable public access for Power BI. 

Log in into the app.powerbi.com as an administrator, and navigate to the **Admin portal**. Select **Tenant settings** and scroll to the **Advanced networking** section. Enable the toggle button in the **Block Public Internet Access** section, as shown in the following image. It takes approximately 15 minutes for the system to disable your organization's access to Power BI from the public Internet.

And that's it - after following these steps, Power BI for your organizations is only accessible from private endpoints, and not accessible from the public Internet. 

## Considerations and limitations

There are a few considerations to keep in mind while working with private endpoints in Power BI:

* Any use of external images or themes are not available when using a private link environment.
* If Internet access is disabled, and if the dataset or dataflow is connecting to a Power BI dataset or dataflow as a data source, the connection will fail.
* Usage metrics do *not* work when private endpoints are enabled.
* Publish to Web is not supported when you enable **Azure Private Link** in Power BI.
* Email subscriptions are not supported when you enable **Block Public Internet Access** in Power BI. 
* [Microsoft Information Protection (MIP)](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection?view=o365-worldwide) does not currently support Private Links. This means that in [Power BI Desktop](service-security-sensitivity-label-overview.md#sensitivity-labels-in-power-bi-desktop-preview) running in an isolated network, the Sensitivity button will be grayed out, label information will not appear, and decryption of *.pbix* files will fail.

   To enable these capabilities in Power BI Desktop, admins can configure [Service Tags](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) for the underlying services that support MIP, [EOP](/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#eopexternalpublishedips) and AIP. Please make sure you understand the implications of using Service Tags in a Private Links isolated network.
* Gateways enabled for Power BI private endpoints will not work properly with non-Power BI scenarios.
